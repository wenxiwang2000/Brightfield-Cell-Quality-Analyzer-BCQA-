Hi, nice to meet you! This section shows how to use the AI-assisted segmentation tool to train brightfield cell “thickness” quantification as a practical standard for cell quality assessment.

Workflow: Start with an example input/output, then iteratively tune the segmentation parameters (based on Otsu thresholding) and manually mark/correct results. With each correction, the auto output becomes more accurate and efficient.
